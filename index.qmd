* "The miracle is this - the more we share, the more we have" â€• Leonard Nimoy*

I'm a roboticist working at the intersection of AI/ML, control theory and distributed systems.

I attended the University of Messina for my undergraduate studies and returned there for my Research Fellowship.

I also hold degrees from University of Genova and Ecole Centrale de Nantes where I studied under an ERASMUS Mundus scholarship program and I completed my PhD.

I'm currently a Research Fellow at Future Computing Research Laboratory of University of Messina under the supervision of prof. Massimo Villari, where I currently follow lines of research about Distributed Learning, Physics-Informed Machine Learning and Clinical Data Modeling.
