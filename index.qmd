## Bio

I'm a roboticist working at the intersection of AI/ML, control theory and distributed systems.

I attended the [University of Messina](https://www.unime.it) for my undergraduate studies and came back there for my Research Fellowship.

I also hold degrees from [University of Genova](https://www.unige.it) and [Ecole Centrale de Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr) where I studied under an [ERASMUS Mundus scholarship program (EMARO)](https://master-emaro.ec-nantes.fr/) and I completed my PhD.

I'm currently a Research Fellow at [Future Computing Research Laboratory](https://fcrlab.unime.it) of University of Messina under the supervision of [prof. Massimo Villari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LogifUkAAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao), where I currently follow lines of research about Distributed Learning, Physics-Informed Machine Learning and Clinical Data Modeling.


## Key research interest

* **Robotics and Autonomous Systems:** Aerial Robot Modeling, Data-Driven Control, Lagrangian modeling, DMOC (Discrete Mechanics and Optimal Control)

* **Scientific Machine Learning:** Physics-Informed Neural Network, Neural Stochastic Differential Equations

* **Distributed Learning:** Federated Learning, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning


## Personal Life

I am married to Chiara and I am the father of Emma and Agnese. I have a past as a scout educator in AGESCI (Italian Catholic Guides and Scouts Association), and a present as a volunteer with Migrantes, a reality that is all-around involved in the promotion of migrants and refugees in my city.

I love music and studied piano for five years at the Conservatory of Messina. I listen in particular to Jazz music, progressive rock and classical music (with a boundless love for Bach and Debussy).

I love to cook, especially first courses and appetizers, with a preference for traditional Mediterranean dishes.
