    "text": "I am a visiting thesis supervisor for students on the data science track of the mathematics programme at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. If you’re intending to write your thesis on a topic related to my research interests, you’re probably in the right place.\n\nProcedural aspects\nEach year, the department publishes a list of thesis topics. You can find the list for the current academic year. If you’re interested in one of the topics, you should contact the supervisor listed for that topic. If you’re interested in one of my topics, you should contact me.\nAs I am not full-time faculty, you will need to find an internal supervisor as well. The department has been very supportive of my students in the past, so this should not be a problem.\nWhile not a strict requirement, I would be very grateful if students aspiring to work with me could please make themselves known a few months before start of term. This will allow me to plan my time better, and to make sure that I can give you the attention you deserve."
